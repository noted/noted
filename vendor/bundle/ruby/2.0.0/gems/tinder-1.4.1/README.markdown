# Tinder - get the Campfire started

Tinder is a library for interfacing with Campfire, the chat application from 37Signals, allowing you to programmatically manage and speak/listen in chat rooms.  As of December 2009, thanks to initial work from Joshua Peek at 37signals, it now makes use of the official Campfire API (described at: http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/).

## Usage

    campfire = Tinder::Campfire.new 'mysubdomain', :token => '546884b3d8fee4d80665g561caf7h9f3ea7b999e'
    # or you can still use username/password and Tinder will look up your token
    # campfire = Tinder::Campfire.new 'mysubdomain', :username => 'user', :password => 'pass'
  
    room = campfire.rooms.first
    room.rename 'New Room Names'
    room.speak 'Hello world!'
    room.paste "my pasted\ncode"

    room = campfire.find_room_by_guest_hash 'abc123', 'John Doe'
    room.speak 'Hello world!'
  
See the RDoc for more details.
