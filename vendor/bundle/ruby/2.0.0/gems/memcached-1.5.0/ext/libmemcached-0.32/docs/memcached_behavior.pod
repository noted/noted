memcached_behavior_get, memcached_behavior_set - Manipulate behavior

=head1 LIBRARY

C Client Library for memcached (libmemcached, -lmemcached)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <memcached.h>

  uint64_t
    memcached_behavior_get (memcached_st *ptr,
                            memcached_behavior flag);

  memcached_return
    memcached_behavior_set (memcached_st *ptr,
                            memcached_behavior flag,
                            uint64_t data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

libmemcached(3) behavior can be modified by use memcached_behavior_set().
Default behavior is the library strives to be quick and accurate. Some
behavior, while being faster, can also result in not entirely accurate
behavior (for instance, memcached_set() will always respond with
C<MEMCACHED_SUCCESS>).

memcached_behavior_get() takes a behavior flag and returns whether or not
that behavior is currently enabled in the client.

memcached_behavior_set() changes the value of a particular option of the
client. It takes both a flag (listed below) and a value. For simple on or
off options you just need to pass in a value of 1. Calls to
memcached_behavior_set() will flush and reset all connections.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USE_UDP

Causes libmemcached(3) to use the UDP transport when communicating
with a memcached server. Not all I/O operations are supported
when this behavior is enababled. The following operations will return
C<MEMCACHED_NOT_SUPPORTED> when executed with the MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USE_UDP
enabled: memcached_version(), memcached_stat(), memcached_get(),
memcached_get_by_key(), memcached_mget(), memcached_mget_by_key(),
memcached_fetch(), memcached_fetch_result(), memcached_value_fetch().

All other operations are supported but are executed in a 'fire-and-forget'
mode, in which once the client has executed the operation, no attempt
will be made to ensure the operation has been received and acted on by the
server.

libmemcached(3) does not allow TCP and UDP servers to be shared within
the same libmemached(3) client 'instance'. An attempt to add a TCP server
when this behavior is enabled will result in a C<MEMCACHED_INVALID_HOST_PROTOCOL>,
as will attempting to add a UDP server when this behavior has not been enabled.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_NO_BLOCK

Causes libmemcached(3) to use asychronous IO. This is the fastest transport
available for storage functions.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SND_TIMEOUT

This sets the microsecond behavior of the socket against the SO_SNDTIMEO flag.
In cases where you cannot use non-blocking IO this will allow you to still have
timeouts on the sending of data.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_RCV_TIMEOUT

This sets the microsecond behavior of the socket against the SO_RCVTIMEO flag.
In cases where you cannot use non-blocking IO this will allow you to still have
timeouts on the reading of data.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_TCP_NODELAY

Turns on the no-delay feature for connecting sockets (may be faster in some
environments).

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_HASH

Makes the default hashing algorithm for keys use MD5. The value can be set
to either MEMCACHED_HASH_DEFAULT, MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5, MEMCACHED_HASH_CRC, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_64, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_64, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_32, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_32, MEMCACHED_HASH_JENKINS, MEMCACHED_HASH_HSIEH, and MEMCACHED_HASH_MURMUR.
Each hash has it's advantages and it's weaknesses. If you dont know or dont care, just go with the default.
Support for MEMCACHED_HASH_HSIEH is a compile time option that is disabled by default. To enable support for this hashing algorithm, configure and build libmemcached with the --enable-hash_hsieh.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_DISTRIBUTION

Using this you can enable different means of distributing values to servers.
The default method is MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_MODULA. You can enable
consistent hashing by setting MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT.
Consistent hashing delivers better distribution and allows servers to be
added to the cluster with minimal cache losses. Currently
MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT is an alias for the value
MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_CACHE_LOOKUPS

Memcached can cache named lookups so that DNS lookups are made only once.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SUPPORT_CAS

Support CAS operations (this is not enabled by default at this point in the server since it imposes a slight performance penalty).

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA

Sets the default distribution to MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA
and the hash to MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA_WEIGHTED

Sets the default distribution to MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA with the weighted support.
and the hash to MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA_HASH

Sets the hashing algorithm for host mapping on continuum. The value can be set
to either MEMCACHED_HASH_DEFAULT, MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5, MEMCACHED_HASH_CRC, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_64, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_64, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_32, and MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_32.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_POLL_TIMEOUT

Modify the timeout value that is used by poll(). The default value is -1. An signed int pointer must be passed to memcached_behavior_set() to change this value. For memcached_behavior_get() a signed int value will be cast and returned as the unsigned long long.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USER_DATA

This allows you to store a pointer to a specifc piece of data. This can be
retrieved from inside of memcached_fetch_execute(). Cloning a memcached_st

will copy the pointer to the clone. This was deprecated in 0.14 in favor
of memcached_callback_set(3). This will be removed in 0.15.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_BUFFER_REQUESTS

Enabling buffered IO causes commands to "buffer" instead of being sent. Any
action that gets data causes this buffer to be be sent to the remote
connection. Quiting the connection or closing down the connection will also
cause the buffered data to be pushed to the remote connection.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_VERIFY_KEY

Enabling this will cause libmemcached(3) to test all keys to verify that they
are valid keys.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SORT_HOSTS

Enabling this will cause hosts that are added to be placed in the host list in
sorted order. This will defeat consisten hashing.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT

In non-blocking mode this changes the value of the timeout during socket
connection.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_BINARY_PROTOCOL

Enable the use of the binary protocol. Please note that you cannot toggle
this flag on an open connection.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT

Set this value to enable the server be removed after continuous MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT
times connection failure.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_MSG_WATERMARK

Set this value to tune the number of messages that may be sent before
libmemcached should start to automatically drain the input queue. Setting
this value to high, may cause libmemcached to deadlock (trying to send data,
but the send will block because the input buffer in the kernel is full).

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_BYTES_WATERMARK

Set this value to tune the number of bytes that may be sent before
libmemcached should start to automatically drain the input queue (need
at least 10 IO requests sent without reading the input buffer). Setting
this value to high, may cause libmemcached to deadlock (trying to send
data, but the send will block because the input buffer in the kernel is full).

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_KEY_PREFETCH

The binary protocol works a bit different than the textual protocol in
that a multiget is implemented as a pipe of single get-operations which
are sent to the server in a chunk. If you are using large multigets from
your application, you may improve the latency of the gets by setting
this value so you send out the first chunk of requests when you hit the
specified limit.  It allows the servers to start processing the requests
to send the data back while the rest of the requests are created and
sent to the server.

=item MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_NOREPLY

Set this value to specify that you really don't care about the result
from your storage commands (set, add, replace, append, prepend).

=head1 RETURN

memcached_behavior_get() returns either the current value of the get, or 0
or 1 on simple flag behaviors (1 being enabled). memcached_behavior_set()
returns failure or success.

=head1 NOTES

memcached_behavior_set() in version .17 was changed from taking a pointer
to data value, to taking a uin64_t.
