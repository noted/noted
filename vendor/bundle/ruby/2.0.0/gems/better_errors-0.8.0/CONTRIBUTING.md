# Contributing to Better Errors

Please make sure to follow these guidelines when contributing code to Better Errors. They will improve the chances of your pull request being merged and they will make my life easier.

* If you are contributing a large-ish change, please split your changes up into small, logical commits. This is so I have the option of merging in some but not all of your commits. If you just give me one huge commit and there are things that I don't want to merge in, I won't.

* Whitespace at the end of lines of code is not OK, but empty lines with indentation is fine. Please do not remove these when sending in changes.

* Don't change things that are unrelated to your main changes unnecessarily. Send another pull request for these changes - don't try to sneak them in.
