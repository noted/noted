## Description

Noted is an academic research assistant and management tool. It is meant to allow students to ease the research workflow through source search tools and collaboration. Students can sign up for free with some features limit or with a small monthly fee for full access. They can also get access through their institution.

## Overview

For my senior year at high school, I decided to do a capstone project. Students are given a (relatively) large amount of freedom to do whatever they’d like with this project, whether it be academic, charitable, or innovative.

Besides AP Computer Science, there aren’t many courses that align with what I love doing. So, I see this as a great opportunity—I get to do something that I love doing, but get school credit for it. Since I’ve had the idea to do this project for years, having the ability to do it with the support of my school is wonderful.

In about eighth grade, we began using a product that aimed to help students manage their research project by generating citations and keeping track of notes. While easier than manually writing down all of the information that goes with citations, it still was frustrating to use. Every time a teacher said we would be using this product for a project, the class would groan in unison. But more importantly, there was quite a steep learning curve—this makes it difficult to teach younger students.

Plus, the featureset that this product has was very restrained—in this niche, there is a lot of room for innovation. Keeping track of a research project and its related information is something that quite a few people have a use for, including students, teachers, and researchers, so making it easier is something that no one has really taken a big step in.

Thus, the idea for Noted was born.

Noted is more than a research management tool, but a collaboration, discovery, and publishing tool as well. My aim is to make keeping track of your research not a burden, but something that feels natural and easy. Working with others should be as simple as finding a project you’re interested in and contributing. And finally, making the results of your research available to the public can be as simple as clicking a button.

This project is still in its infancy. I’ve never created a business before—that will be difficult. There is an entire course at my school that does exactly that (e-commerce), so learning it all by myself and in half the time will be a challenge.

I look forward to working on this project, as it is something I’m genuinely interested in. I have one foot in academics, and another in the career of my choice. Combining the two will be a great experience not only for me, but hopefully for the students I help with the results.
